Whachapay
=========

Whachapay is a crowd-sourced automobile pricing site. It supports two use cases:

#. Users who have purchased a car and want to share their deal with the community enter their car details, the dealership they purchased from, and how much they paid.
#. Users who are shopping for a car enter the year/make/model they are looking for and their location, and see average prices for dealerships in their area, allowing them to learn the fair market price.

The site uses the Google Maps `Web Services`_ and JavaScript_ APIs to provide dynamic results for automobile dealerships; thus it can be used in any location without the need to manually manage dealership data.

The site is hosted here_. Sample deals can be browsed by selecting a 2012 BMW 3 Series, entering Honolulu, HI for the location and selecting *Find a Deal*.
